This project represents a web application for managing patients who test different medication, information which is stored in a database.
By using the app, the user can view different tables, edit, delete or add new data. There are also search bars coded with SQL querries containing JOIN or subquerries. There is a clear difference between the permissions of what a simple user may do and what the admin is allowed to do.
The main languages used are Java through the Spring Boot Framework and SQL for the database manipulation.
